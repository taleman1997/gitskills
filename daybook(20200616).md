## Inductor searching 

### Requirement of the inductor(Based on yesterday's file)
1. The inductance should be $5 \mu H$
2. The max current of the inductor should abouve $5.5A$
3. The inductor should maintance the characteristics in proper current range

### Search result:
I searched $5 \mu H$ inductor and found three types of possible inductors
1. [38S502C](http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/1790383.pdf?_ga=2.266994505.63016485.1592301573-1396917834.1591382971&_gac=1.120671226.1592301573.CjwKCAjw26H3BRB2EiwAy32zhUpIvihK0Hzw-bXFtPxBfHayH1WtaqbKj2V4FkX5UfU6lk0gsF4HFhoCvf4QAvD_BwE)
2. [744066005](http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/1920144.pdf?_ga=2.224224860.63016485.1592301573-1396917834.1591382971&_gac=1.26485711.1592301573.CjwKCAjw26H3BRB2EiwAy32zhUpIvihK0Hzw-bXFtPxBfHayH1WtaqbKj2V4FkX5UfU6lk0gsF4HFhoCvf4QAvD_BwE)
3. [Shielded Drum Core - P1170NL/P1171NL Series](https://www.mouser.co.uk/datasheet/2/336/-514292.pdf)

According to the datasheet, I prefer to choose [38S502C](http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/1790383.pdf?_ga=2.266994505.63016485.1592301573-1396917834.1591382971&_gac=1.120671226.1592301573.CjwKCAjw26H3BRB2EiwAy32zhUpIvihK0Hzw-bXFtPxBfHayH1WtaqbKj2V4FkX5UfU6lk0gsF4HFhoCvf4QAvD_BwE) inductor. Reasons are as below:

1. The inductance of this type inductor remains $5 \mu H$

   For [744066005](http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/1920144.pdf?_ga=2.224224860.63016485.1592301573-1396917834.1591382971&_gac=1.26485711.1592301573.CjwKCAjw26H3BRB2EiwAy32zhUpIvihK0Hzw-bXFtPxBfHayH1WtaqbKj2V4FkX5UfU6lk0gsF4HFhoCvf4QAvD_BwE), the inductance will drop as the current goes into 5A. The graph is as below.

2. The reason for not pick [Shielded Drum Core - P1170NL/P1171NL Series](https://www.mouser.co.uk/datasheet/2/336/-514292.pdf) is the physical dimension. It has the largest physical dimension. I think it has the largest core. And the core loss need to be considered.
   ![graph-3](/graph/core.png)
I did not analysis more on core loss because I think the electrical characteristic is enough to help me to make the choice.

Therefore, I may pick [38S502C](http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/1790383.pdf?_ga=2.266994505.63016485.1592301573-1396917834.1591382971&_gac=1.120671226.1592301573.CjwKCAjw26H3BRB2EiwAy32zhUpIvihK0Hzw-bXFtPxBfHayH1WtaqbKj2V4FkX5UfU6lk0gsF4HFhoCvf4QAvD_BwE) inductor. If this inductor still inappropriate for the converter, I think I may focus on the planar inducor.


## Study about planar inductor
I found some other papers and website which I think could help me to design the planar inductor.

I found that there are basicall four type shapes of planar inductors. Circular, Square, Hexagnal and Octagonal. I still confused the influence of the topology of the planar inductor.

Besides, I found a website might helpful.[Coil Designer](https://webench.ti.com/wb5/LDC/#/spirals). 

And there are many LDC part types. Different types has different characteristics. For the aim inductor is $5 \mu H$ and the frequency is $2MHz$, the impedance of the inductor is $2*\pi*f*L = 62.83\Omega$. And the ripple current is $0.5A$. Then the Oscillate voltage is $31.41V$(peak to peak). But the amplitude still big. All the types inductor in the website has oscillate volate range $1V - 4V$

I tried several types of planar inductor, and this is one of the them.

I just want to comfirm that, in the output parametes, Current need to be 5A. Because the explaination of this parameter from the website confused me a bit. This website can help to generate the footprint and schematic of the planar inductor. So the task in the following days should focus on the design of the inductor.
